      <h2 style="font-size:xx-large;">The 10 Best Chess Players Of All Time</h2>
      <hr>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#10 Alexander Alekhine</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/ten.jpeg" width="300">
        <p>Alexander Alekhine. Photo: Wikimedia.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Alexander Alekhine was the fourth official world champion and held the title from 1927 to
        1946 (with an exception during 1935-1937). He was a brilliant and well-rounded player with a special ability for
        combinational play in complex positions. He also taught the chess world that rules and principles can be broken
        based on concrete analysis of the specific and unique position.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Alekhine became world champion by defeating Jose Raul Capablanca in 1927, despite being a
        large underdog (he had never won a single game against Capablanca before the match).
        Alekhine's reign as world champion was long, but he successfully defended his title only twice (both times
        against GM Efim Bogoljubow in 1929 and 1934). Capablanca and Alekhine never had a rematch for the world
        championship due to various reasons. Alekhine faced GM Max Euwe for the world championship in 1935 and
        surprisingly lost the match.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Two years later Alekhine won the rematch against Euwe to earn the crown back, but he would
        never defend it again. He passed away in 1946 as the world champion, the only champion ever to do so (although
        he was finalizing the details to play a match with Botvinnik).</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#9 Mikhail Tal</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/nine.jpeg" width="400">
        <p>Mikhail Tal. Photo: Ron Kroon/Dutch National Archive</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;GM Mikhail Tal, also known as the "Magician from Riga," was the eighth official world
        champion. He defeated Botvinnik in 1960 to earn the crown at the age of 23 and a half, becoming the youngest
        world champion in history at the time (although this record was broken by both Kasparov and Carlsen).
        Known for his brilliant and unique attacking style, Tal's approach to the game has been an inspiration for
        attacking players for decades. One of his famous bone-chilling quotes is, "You must take your opponent into a
        deep dark forest where 2+2=5, and the path leading out is only wide enough for one."</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#8 Emanuel Lasker</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/eight.jpeg" width="400">
        <p>Emanuel Lasker. Photo: German Federal Archives</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Emanuel Lasker was the second official world champion and held the title for 27 years. His
        reign from 1894 to 1921 is the longest of any world chess champion, and his playing career lasted five decades.
        Lasker defeated the first official world champion Wilhelm Steinitz in 1894, and he defended his title five times
        against a host of world-class contenders, including Frank Marshall, Siegbert Tarrasch, David Janowsky, and Carl
        Schlechter. </p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;In 1921 Lasker lost the title to Capablanca but continued to play at the highest level. He
        placed third in the 1935 Moscow tournament at the age of 66, half a point behind Botvinnik and Salo Flohr, but
        ahead of Capablanca, the first women's world champion Vera Menchik and 15 other masters. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#7 Vladimir Kramnik</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/seven.jpeg" width="400">
        <p>Vladimir Kramnik. Photo: Peter Parker</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;GM Vladimir Kramnik was world champion from 2000 to 2007. He became the classical world
        champion by dethroning the legendary Kasparov in 2000, defended his title in 2004 against GM Peter Leko and in
        2006 faced the FIDE world champion Topalov in a title unification match. Kramnik defeated Topalov to become the
        first undisputed world champion since Kasparov in 1993.
        At his peak, Kramnik's game had absolutely no weak points—he could do it all. He was known for his fantastic
        endgame play and his clean, tenacious and positional style. Kramnik is considered one of the most difficult
        players to defeat in the history of the game. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#6 Mikhail Botvinnik</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/six.jpeg" width="500">
        <p>Mikhail Botvinnik. Photo: Harry Pot/Dutch National Archives</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;GM Mikhail Botvinnik is known as the "father of the Soviet chess school." The sixth world
        champion reigned from 1948 to 1963 (with two brief intermissions) and was a top player for over 30 years.
        Botvinnik's style was dictated by iron logic and flexibility, although he was extremely talented with methodical
        and strategical planning. His flexible style allowed him to adapt to all different types of playing styles.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;He became world champion in 1948, defended his title against GM David Bronstein in 1951 and
        defeated GM Vassily Smyslov in 1954. In 1957 Smyslov defeated Botvinnik, who won their rematch the following
        year (at that time the world champion had the right to a rematch if they lost the title). In 1960 Botvinnik was
        defeated by Tal, but history repeated itself as Botvinnik won their rematch in 1961.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#5 Anatoly Karpov</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/five.jpeg" width="400">
        <p>Anatoly Karpov. Photo: R.C. Kroes/Dutch National Archives</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;GM Anatoly Karpov was the 12th world champion and reigned from 1975 to 1985 while also
        being the FIDE world champion from 1993 to 1999. Karpov was an exceptionally well-rounded player, but his
        specialty was positional binds, prophylactic play, and wonderful endgame technique.
        Karpov became world champion by default when Fischer withdrew from their 1975 match because his demands weren't
        met. Karpov defended his crown by defeating GM Viktor Korchnoi in 1978 and again in 1981. In 1984 Karpov would
        have his first meeting with Kasparov, and the chess world was changed forever.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;In the first of five matches between the two legendary titans, the match was called early
        with Karpov leading five wins, three losses, and 40 draws. In 1985 Kasparov defeated Karpov and claimed the
        chess crown. They played again in 1986, 1987 and 1990 and when their matches were concluded their lifetime
        record in world championship matches was 19 wins for Karpov, 21 wins for Kasparov and 104 draws!
        In 1993 Kasparov broke away from FIDE (creating the PCA), and Karpov became the FIDE world champion. Karpov
        defended his FIDE world champion title by defeating GM Jan Timman in 1993, GM Gata Kamsky in 1996 and Anand in
        1998 (on tiebreaks). Karpov refused to play in the 1999 FIDE world championship tournament after FIDE changed
        their rules.
        Karpov's legendary games continue to be a source of inspiration for all positional and endgame players today.
        Tibor Karolyi's two-volume work titled Karpov's Strategic Wins is considered one of the best chess books ever
        written.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#4 Jose Raul Capablanca</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/four.jpeg" width="300">
        <p>Jose Raul Capablanca. Photo: Wikimedia</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Jose Raul Capablanca was the third official world champion and possibly the most talented
        chess player ever to play the game. From 1916 through 1924 he amassed a tournament record of 40 wins and 23
        draws, an unprecedented feat at the time and still a historically significant achievement. Capablanca's talent
        and skill were unmatched during his eight-year period.
        , Capablanca became world champion by defeating the legendary Lasker in 1921. Many believe that Capablanca would
        have defeated Lasker had he been given the chance before 1921, and many believe that he would have reclaimed the
        title had he been given an opportunity for a rematch with Alekhine. Unfortunately for Capablanca, his peak
        playing time happened both during and between World War I and World War II.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Every world champion and contender is well-rounded, but Capablanca had a special gift for
        the endgame. Even now (in the engine era of chess) it is difficult to poke holes in his endgame play. Irving
        Chernev's book Capablanca's Best Chess Endings is a classic.
        Going eight years without a single loss and becoming world champion are something the chess world won't ever see
        again, and only Capablanca achieved this feat.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#3 Bobby Fischer</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/three.jpeg" width="500">
        <p>Bobby Fischer. Photo: Bert Verhoeff/Dutch National Archives</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;GM Bobby Fischer was the 11th official world champion as well as the first and only
        American world champion. He is considered by many to be the most famous chess player ever. From 1970 to 1971
        Fischer won 20 consecutive games against world-class opposition, an unprecedented and mind-boggling achievement
        that will most likely never be equaled. This feat is counted among the seven most amazing chess records.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;In 1972 Fischer defeated Spassky in the "Match of the Century" and was crowned world
        champion, despite starting the match with a 0-2 score after throwing away game one in a completely equal endgame
        and not even showing up for game two. Fischer's dismantling of the Soviet chess empire from 1970 to 1972 during
        the midst of the Cold War is considered one of the greatest individual performances of all time.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;His style was unique, original and creative. He could attack and defend with the best of
        them, but he also showed a very deep and almost scary positional understanding. Fischer inspired multiple
        generations of chess players in the U.S. and around the world. </p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;ischer's "Game of the Century" is one of the most famous chess games of all time, and his
        book titled My 60 Memorable Games is considered one of the best chess books in history.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#2 Magnus Carlsen</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/two.jpeg" width="400">
        <p>Magnus Carlsen. Photo: Peter Parker</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first"> &nbsp;GM Magnus Carlsen is the reigning world champion for all three time controls (standard,
        rapid and blitz). In 2009 he became the youngest player in history to reach the 2800-rating threshold, and on
        April 21, 2014, he reached his peak rating and the highest rating ever at 2889.
        Carlsen has been the number-one ranked player since 2011 and has been dominating the game ever since. As of
        February 2020, Carlsen has been on a 120-game undefeated streak in standard time controls, another record for
        the world champion.
        His resume is already more than enough to be considered number two on this list of the best players of all time,
        but Carlsen is only 29 years old and may not have even reached his peak playing strength!</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Carlsen became the world champion by defeating Anand in 2013 just before turning 23 years
        old (the second-youngest world champion ever, behind only Kasparov). He has successfully defended his title
        three times: in 2014 Carlsen won the rematch against Anand, in 2016 he defeated GM Sergey Karjakin and in 2018
        he defeated GM Fabiano Caruana.
        Carlsen himself does not believe he has earned the #1 spot on this list. According to an interview in January
        2020, Carlsen states: "Kasparov had 20 years uninterrupted as the world number 1...He must be considered as the
        best in history. But I feel that time is on my side...I'm not 30 yet. If I were to be considered the best in
        history at 30, I would have had to start dominating at 10."</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h4 class="altBaslik">#1 Garry Kasparov</h4>
      <br>
      <div class="item">
        <img src="img/one.jpeg" width="400">
        <p>Garry Kasparov. Photo: David Monniaux</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;GM Garry Kasparov is the 13th world champion and held the title from 1985 to 2000. He first
        reached the number-one ranking in 1984 and with a few minor exceptions remained the number-one player in the
        world until 2006. Kasparov dominated the chess world for over 20 years.
        Kasparov reached his peak rating of 2856 on March 3, 2000—at the time an unprecedented number and a record that
        wasn't broken until Carlsen surpassed it.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;In 1985 Kasparov defeated Karpov to become the youngest world champion ever at the age of
        roughly 22 and a half. He defended the world championship title against Karpov on three consecutive occasions in
        1986, 1987 and 1990. In 1993, he broke away from FIDE and started the PCA—this break would create two different
        world championships until the reunification match between Kramnik and Topalov in 2006.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Kasparov defended his title by defeating GM Nigel Short in 1993 and successfully defended
        his title again by defeating Anand in 1995. Kasparov and Lasker are the only two world champions to defend their
        titles successfully five times.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;In 2000 Kramnik defeated Kasparov, ending the reign of the best player of all time as world
        champion. However, Kasparov would continue playing in (and winning) tournaments until his retirement in 2005—he
        left the game as the number-one player in the world.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Kasparov has remained active in the chess world after his effective retirement. He has
        played exhibition matches and even trained Carlsen and GM Hikaru Nakamura. His five-volume series titled My
        Great Predecessors is considered one of the best chess books ever.</p>

        <p>Vera Menchik. Photo: David Monniaux</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Vera Menchik, the first women’s world champion, proved nearly 100 years ago that chess was
        not just a man’s game. In possibly her best tournament, playing on a team with Jose Capablanca among others at
        Ramsgate in 1929, Menchik went undefeated in seven games. She won her matchups against George Alan Thomas,
        Reginald Pryce Michell, and Hubert Ernest Price and drew the rest. Those three wins without a loss matched the
        performance of all-time great GM Akiba Rubinstein in the same tournament, and was a half-point ahead of her
        former teacher GM Geza Maroczy. </p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Menchik had an even lifetime score against world champion GM Max Euwe in five games (+2 =1
        -2) and U.S. champion GM Samuel Reshevsky in two bouts (+1 -1), but it was Austria’s Albert Becker who
        reportedly created the “Vera Menchik Club” by losing to her at the 1929 Carlsbad tournament after mocking her
        participation in the tournament. </p>
      <br>

        <img src="img/wfour.jpeg" width="500">
        <p>GM Nona Gaprindashvili. Photo: Dutch National Archive</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;GM Nona Gaprindashvili became the first female grandmaster in 1978—not to be confused with
        the Woman Grandmaster (WGM) title—after a resounding success at the 1977 tournament in Lone Pine, California.
        There, with a 6.5 score out of nine possible, she tied for first place with grandmasters Yuri Balashov, Dragutin
        Sahovic, and Oscar Panno. </p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Gaprindashvili’s legacy was already cemented even without her GM title. She was women’s
        world champion for 16 years, taking that title from IM Elisaveta Bykova in 1962, and defending it four times.
        Gaprindashvili had twice won the Soviet Women's Championship and would win it three more times as a GM. She
        dominated the women's Olympiad, playing in 12 of them and scoring +94 =26 -8 while winning team gold 11 times
        and individual gold eight times. </p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Gaprindashvili has continued to play serious chess well into her 70s, crafting a career
        spanning more than half a century, nearly six decades. In 1995, she became the women's senior world champion
        after having been world champion. Twenty-four years later, in 2019 at age 78, Gaprindashvili was the women's 65+
        world senior champion for the fifth time.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Few can compete with Gaprindashvili's combination of strength and longevity. Among those
        who can is one of her fellow countrywomen.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;GM Maia Chiburdanidze defeated fellow Georgian Gaprindashvili for the women’s world
        championship in 1978. She was 17 years old at the time, the youngest ever, and went on to hold the title for 13
        years, winning four further matches in defense. In the meantime, Chiburdanidze would earn the GM title herself
        in 1984, at the age of 23. From there, she became the first woman to crack the top 50 in rating since FIDE began
        tracking an official list in July 1971. In January 1988, with a 2560 rating, Chiburdanidze reached #48 in the
        world. Only one other female player has done so since (as of February 2021).</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Chiburdanidze matched up particularly well against GM Nigel Short, going undefeated in her
        two career games against the Englishman in 1983 and '85. The latter came at Banja Luka, a tournament
        Chiburdanidze won with a score of four wins and six draws. Less than a decade later, Short would be playing for
        the world championship.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Chiburdanidze played in 15 Olympiads from 1978-2008, seven for the USSR and then eight for
        Georgia. She was on the first board all 15 times, even with Gaprindashvili competing for position until 1994. In
        her last Olympiad, at the age of 47 in 2008, Chiburdanidze led Georgia to victory with a gold-winning +6 =3 in
        her individual games, including a win over the then-reigning women's world champion, Kosteniuk. </p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Building off the success of Chiburdanidze and Gaprindashvili, women's chess in Georgia is
        quite strong. Five female GMs hail from there and despite a current population of about four million. Georgia
        has over 30 women rated above 2000 by FIDE. That's only four fewer than the nearly 100-times-larger United
        States, and more than half as many as the 250-times larger China, neither of which are weak chess countries!
        China has, in fact, one of the two players ranked ahead of Chiburdanidze on this list, with...</p>

      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;As the strongest woman (since our #1 retired) during one of the strongest periods of chess
        in history, GM Hou Yifan is near the top of this list. In 2010 Hou, 16, broke Chiburdanidze’s record for
        youngest women’s world champion. Two years before that, she had surpassed even Judit Polgar by becoming a GM at
        14 years old, making her the youngest female GM ever (a record she still holds as of February 2021). Hou would
        win the championship twice more, in 2013 and 2016, before shifting her focus to open events.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;It was a reasonable course of action, as Hou soon achieved great success at Biel in 2017.
        She won outright with 6.5 out of 9 with a performance rating of 2810. It was a field that included a FIDE world
        champion (GM Ruslan Ponomariov), a classical world championship finalist (GM Peter Leko), and four other super
        GMs (players whose rating peaked above 2700). That same year at the GRENKE Chess Classic she defeated GM Fabiano
        Caruana, who would be playing for the world championship a year later.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;At various points in Hou's career, she has taken a break from professional chess to focus
        on her education and career outside of chess. She was a Rhodes Scholar in 2018 and in July 2020 she became a
        full-time professor at Shenzhen University at the age of 26. Hou has not entirely left chess, playing two
        international team competitions in 2020 including the Chess.com Online Nations Cup, and the game of chess plays
        a key role in her professorship at Shenzhen University.</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Hou peaked at 55th in the world on the May 2015 FIDE rating list, just shy of
        Chiburdanidze's top ranking, but Hou has faced somewhat stronger competition; Chiburdanidze rarely if ever
        played in fields quite as strong as Biel or GRENKE 2017. Still, the #2 spot on our list was perhaps the toughest
        call to make. Who to have #1, meanwhile, was the easiest.</p>

      <h4 class="altBaslikWomen">#1 GM Judit Polgar </h4>
      <br>

        <p>GM Judit Polgar. Photo: Photo: Peter Parker</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;GM Judit Polgar is the only player on this list who never became women’s world champion,
        but with good reason: she never tried to obtain that title. She was simply too strong of a player and was
        better-suited in open events. She has won games against GMs Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen, both while they
        were #1 in the world. Polgar has even toppled GM Bobby Fischer: When Polgar earned the grandmaster title in
        1991, she was the youngest ever, beating Fischer’s record. (Fischer would stay at the Polgar household for a
        time in 1993.)</p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;By the time Polgar was 21 years old, New York Times chess columnist GM Robert Byrne
        declared, “there is no argument about the greatest female player ever." Her position was certainly inarguable by
        the objective rating: in January 1989, when Polgar was 12, she already ranked 55th in the world at 2555, just
        shy of Chiburdanidze's peak. By July 1993, Polgar reached a 2635 rating and joined the world top 20, easily
        surpassing Chiburdanidze’s top marks. On FIDE’s January 1996 rating list, Polgar ranked 10th, a previously
        unimaginable accomplishment. </p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;Byrne wrote his profile of Polgar in 1997, and she only added to her resume after that. In
        January 2003, she joined the 2700 rating club, still the only woman to have done so. The following January,
        Polgar reached eighth on the FIDE rating list, and she stayed in the top ten until 2006. In 2005, Polgar came
        the closest a woman ever has to becoming world chess champion, playing in an eight-player field for the FIDE
        crown (won by GM Veselin Topalov). </p>
      <p class="first">&nbsp;When Polgar retired in 2014, she was still the top-rated woman in chess at 2675. Hou would
        pass her the next year when she reached 2686. By that point, Polgar had been the top-rated female player for a
        quarter of a century, 26 years running all the way back to 1989. Given all of her accomplishments, it is nearly
        impossible to argue that anyone but Judit Polgar is the greatest female chess player of all time.</p>
