      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;Chess, one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by two opponents on a checkered board with
        specially designed pieces of contrasting colours, commonly white and black. White moves first, after which the
        players alternate turns in accordance with fixed rules, each player attempting to force the opponent’s principal
        piece, the King, into checkmate—a position where it is unable to avoid capture.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Chess first appeared in India about the 6th century AD and by the 10th century had spread from Asia to the
        Middle East and Europe. Since at least the 15th century, chess has been known as the “royal game” because of its
        popularity among the nobility. Rules and set design slowly evolved until both reached today’s standard in the
        early 19th century. Once an intellectual diversion favoured by the upper classes, chess went through an
        explosive growth in interest during the 20th century as professional and state-sponsored players competed for an
        officially recognized world championship title and increasingly lucrative tournament prizes. Organized chess
        tournaments, postal correspondence games, and Internet chess now attract men, women, and children around the
        world.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;The origin of chess remains a matter of controversy. There is no credible evidence that chess existed in a form
        approaching the modern game before the 6th century CE. Game pieces found in Russia, China, India, Central Asia,
        Pakistan, and elsewhere that have been determined to be older than that are now regarded as coming from earlier
        distantly related board games, often involving dice and sometimes using playing boards of 100 or more squares.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;One of those earlier games was a war game called chaturanga, a Sanskrit name for a battle formation mentioned
        in the Indian epic Mahabharata. Chaturanga was flourishing in northwestern India by the 7th century and is
        regarded as the earliest precursor of modern chess because it had two key features found in all later chess
        variants—different pieces had different powers (unlike checkers and go), and victory was based on one piece, the
        king of modern chess.
        How chaturanga evolved is unclear. Some historians say chaturanga, perhaps played with dice on a 64-square
        board, gradually transformed into shatranj (or chatrang), a two-player game popular in northern India, Pakistan,
        Afghanistan, and southern parts of Central Asia after 600 CE. Shatranj resembled chaturanga but added a new
        piece, a firzān (counselor), which had nothing to do with any troop formation. A game of shatranj could be won
        either by eliminating all an opponent’s pieces (baring the king) or by ensuring the capture of the king. The
        initial positions of the pawns and knights have not changed, but there were considerable regional and temporal
        variations for the other pieces.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size:xx-large;">Characteristics of the Game</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;Chess is played on a board of 64 squares arranged in eight vertical rows called files and eight horizontal rows
        called ranks. These squares alternate between two colours: one light, such as white, beige, or yellow; and the
        other dark, such as black or green. The board is set between the two opponents so that each player has a
        light-coloured square at the right-hand corner.</p>
      <h4 style="color:black; text-align: left; font-size: x-large;">|Algebraic notation</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Individual moves and entire games can be recorded using one of several forms of
        notation. By far the most widely used form, algebraic (or coordinate) notation, identifies each square from the
        point of view of the player with the light-coloured pieces, called White. The eight ranks are numbered 1 through
        8 beginning with the rank closest to White. The files are labeled a through h beginning with the file at White’s
        left hand. Each square has a name consisting of its letter and number, such as b3 or g8. Additionally, files a
        through d are referred to as the queenside, and files e through h as the kingside.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 style="color:black; text-align: left; font-size: x-large;">|Moves</h4>
      <br>

      <h5 style="color: rgb(121, 14, 14); text-align: left;">King</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;White’s king begins the game on e1. Black’s king is opposite at e8. Each king can
        move one square in any direction; e.g., White’s king can move from e1 to d1, d2, e2, f2, or f1.</p>
      <br>

      <h5 style="color: rgb(121, 14, 14); text-align: left;">Rook</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Each player has two rooks (formerly also known as castles), which begin the game on
        the corner squares a1 and h1 for White, a8 and h8 for Black. A rook can move vertically or horizontally to any
        unobstructed square along the file or rank on which it is placed.</p>
      <br>

      <h5 style="color: rgb(121, 14, 14); text-align: left;">Bishop</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Each player has two bishops, and they begin the game at c1 and f1 for White, c8 and
        f8 for Black. A bishop can move to any unobstructed square on the diagonal on which it is placed. Therefore,
        each player has one bishop that travels only on light-coloured squares and one bishop that travels only on
        dark-coloured squares.</p>
      <br>

      <h5 style="color: rgb(121, 14, 14); text-align: left;">Queen</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Each player has one queen, which combines the powers of the rook and bishop and is
        thus the most mobile and powerful piece. The White queen begins at d1, the Black queen at d8.</p>
      <br>

      <h5 style="color: rgb(121, 14, 14) ; text-align: left;">Knight</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Each player has two knights, and they begin the game on the squares between their
        rooks and bishops—i.e., at b1 and g1 for White and b8 and g8 for Black. The knight has the trickiest move, an
        L-shape of two steps: first one square like a rook, then one square like a bishop, but always in a direction
        away from the starting square. A knight at e4 could move to f2, g3, g5, f6, d6, c5, c3, or d2. The knight has
        the unique ability to jump over any other piece to reach its destination. It always moves to a square of a
        different colour.</p>
      <br>

      <h5 style="color: rgb(121, 14, 14); text-align: left;">Pawns</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Each player has eight pawns, which begin the game on the second rank closest to each
        player; i.e., White’s pawns start at a2, b2, c2, and so on, while Black’s pawns start at a7, b7, c7, and so on.
        The pawns are unique in several ways. A pawn can move only forward; it can never retreat. It moves differently
        than it captures. A pawn moves to the square directly ahead of it but captures on the squares diagonally in
        front of it; e.g., a White pawn at f5 can move to f6 but can capture only on g6 or e6. An unmoved pawn has the
        option of moving one or two squares forward. This is the reason for another peculiar option, called en
        passant—that is, in passing—available to a pawn when an enemy pawn on an adjoining file advances two squares on
        its initial move and could have been captured had it moved only one square. The first pawn can take the
        advancing pawn en passant, as if it had advanced only one square. An en passant capture must be made then or not
        at all. Only pawns can be captured en passant. The last unique feature of the pawn occurs if it reaches the end
        of a file; it must then be promoted to—that is, exchanged for—a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.</p>
      <br>

      <h4 style="color: black; text-align: left; font-size: x-large;">|Object of the Game</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;When a player moves a piece to a square on which it attacks the enemy king—that is, a
        square from which it could capture the king if the king is not shielded or moved—the king is said to be in
        check. The game is won when one king is in check and cannot avoid capture on the next move; this is called
        checkmate. A game also can end when a player, believing the situation to be hopeless, acknowledges defeat by
        resigning.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">There are three possible results in chess: win, lose, or draw. There are six ways a
        draw can come about: (1) by mutual consent, (2) when neither player has enough pieces to deliver checkmate, (3)
        when one player can check the enemy king endlessly (perpetual check), (4) when a player who is not in check has
        no legal move (stalemate), (5) when an identical position occurs three times with the same player having the
        right to move, and (6) when no piece has been captured and no pawn has been moved within a period of 50 moves.
